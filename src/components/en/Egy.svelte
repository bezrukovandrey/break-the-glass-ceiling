            Együttható Association was founded by social professionals, and enthusiastic young volunteers in 2010 to promote non-formal learning, innovative community services and a new way of thinking in youth and social work. When the members of the association were young our vision was to build small, strong communities which eventually could exist free of our daily intervention.  The power of the community could support personal goals, and encourage for cooperation among its members. Society needs to develop through autonomous, supportive communities following a bottom-up approach, in this way inclusivity could be the most natural way of life for the society. If everybody’s voice could be heard and listened to, and the aim was a reasonable agreement for all, then communities could provide equal opportunities but based on the individual needs of support. Equity instead of equality.

Együttható is operating a youth information office in the 4th district of Budapest offering regular events and activities, which serves as an access point to the EURODESK network as well.
