            The "Break the Glass Ceiling" project aims to enhance the quality of youth services, specifically
            volunteering projects under the European Solidarity Corps, by focusing on empowering young
            women. This goal is pursued through comprehensive research, publication and dissemination
            of findings, methods and best practices that promote the empowerment process.

            The project focuses on researching the effectiveness of youth voluntary projects from a female perspective, addressing efficiency gaps in the sector. It will produce a results-based methodology manual and a collection of good practices to guide stakeholders. Dissemination efforts aim to reach over 4,000 experts through events and direct marketing, ensuring widespread adoption of the project's methods. Key outputs include four research plans, reports, and a comprehensive guidance publication to improve youth services.

            Aligned with Erasmus+ priorities, the project supports high-level youth work by addressing the
needs of young women. The outcomes of the project will enhance the recognition and
effectiveness of youth work by providing evidence-based insights and practical tools that
youth organizations and workers can apply to improve their services. Additionally, the project's extensive dissemination efforts will promote the recognition and international
dimension of youth work.

            The importance of this project is underscored by the European Parliament and European
Commission resolutions, which emphasize the need to enhance social inclusion and labor
market participation of young women1. The "Break the Glass Ceiling" project aligns closely
with the goals and priorities of the Erasmus+ program, European Youth Policy objectives, and
the EU Gender Equality Strategy, which focus on ensuring equal treatment, making gender
equality a universal consideration, and introducing targeted measures for women's
empowerment.
