            The "Break the Glass Ceiling" project targets young women both within and outside the
European Union, allowing for the collection of diverse cultural perspectives and the
identification of common features of successful projects from the viewpoint of women's
needs. By examining these projects, the initiative aims to compile best practices from
European Solidarity Corps (ESC) implementing organizations in different countries. The project
ensures that the most appropriate frameworks are provided primarily for women, and that
these results can be generalized for all applicants (NGOs) and policymakers.
